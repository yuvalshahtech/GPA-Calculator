# 🎓 GPA Calculator (Single Subject) — Python + Creative Poster

This project is a simple yet thoughtfully built Python application that takes student marks and converts them into a GPA using clean logic and modular functions.

But this is not just code — it's **visual storytelling**.  
To make the logic feel alive, I’ve also created a **poster using Canva** that visually expresses the transformation:

> Marks (Input) ➝ GPA (Output)  
> Like a glowing balance scale of effort vs achievement ⚖️
